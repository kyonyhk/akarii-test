# Task ID: 8
# Title: Optimize Analysis Prompt and Quality Improvements
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refine the OpenAI prompt template and implement quality controls to achieve â‰¥70% thumbs-up approval rate
# Details:
Analyze thumb vote feedback data, iterate on prompt engineering for better analysis accuracy, implement confidence score thresholding (grey out <0.4 confidence), add prompt guardrails to prevent hallucination, create A/B testing framework for prompt variations, implement feedback-based prompt tuning, add analysis validation rules

# Test Strategy:
Monitor thumb vote approval rates, test confidence score accuracy, validate prompt guardrails prevent nonsensical outputs, measure analysis quality improvements

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze feedback data and identify improvement patterns [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Extract and analyze thumb vote feedback data to identify common failure patterns, approval rate trends, and specific areas where analysis quality is lacking
### Details:
Query thumb vote data from database, calculate current approval rates by analysis type, identify most common failure patterns (hallucinations, incorrect confidence scores, missing context), create data visualization dashboard for feedback trends, document improvement opportunities based on user feedback patterns

## 2. Engineer and iterate on OpenAI prompt templates [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Refine the OpenAI prompt template based on feedback analysis to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations
### Details:
Review current prompt template structure, incorporate feedback patterns into prompt improvements, add explicit instructions for confidence scoring, implement chain-of-thought reasoning in prompts, create prompt variations for A/B testing, add context preservation instructions, implement structured output formatting guidelines

## 3. Implement confidence score thresholding system [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Add confidence score validation and UI indicators to grey out low-confidence analyses
### Details:
Modify analysis pipeline to validate confidence scores, implement UI changes to grey out analyses with <0.4 confidence, add confidence indicator badges, create user education tooltips explaining confidence levels, add option to show/hide low-confidence results, implement confidence score calibration based on historical accuracy

## 4. Create prompt guardrails and validation rules [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Implement guardrails to prevent hallucination and ensure analysis quality standards
### Details:
Add input validation for message content, implement output validation for analysis structure, create fact-checking prompts for controversial claims, add coherence validation between belief and trade-off fields, implement safety filters for inappropriate content, create fallback responses for edge cases, add consistency checks across similar message types

## 5. Build A/B testing framework for prompt variations [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Create infrastructure to test different prompt versions and measure their effectiveness
### Details:
Design A/B test infrastructure with user segmentation, create prompt version management system, implement metrics collection for each prompt variant, build statistical significance testing, create dashboard for experiment results, implement gradual rollout mechanism for winning prompts, add experiment configuration management

## 6. Implement feedback-based prompt tuning system [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.5
### Description: Create automated system to incorporate user feedback into prompt improvements
### Details:
Build feedback collection pipeline from thumb votes, create prompt update triggers based on feedback thresholds, implement automated prompt refinement suggestions, add human-in-the-loop approval for prompt changes, create feedback-to-improvement mapping system, implement continuous learning pipeline for prompt optimization

## 7. Add comprehensive quality validation rules [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4, 8.6
### Description: Implement validation system to ensure analysis meets quality standards before display
### Details:
Create quality scoring rubric for analyses, implement pre-display validation checks, add human review triggers for borderline cases, create quality metrics dashboard, implement automatic retry for failed validations, add quality trend monitoring, create alerts for quality degradation, implement quality-based user experience adjustments
