# Chat Application Enhancement PRD

## Project Overview
Enhancement of existing chat application to modernize UI, improve sharing capabilities, add multi-model AI support, and implement proper role-based access control.

## Requirements

### 1. Modern Chat UI Redesign
**Objective**: Update the UI to match modern chat applications like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack
**Description**: 
- Redesign message bubbles with modern aesthetics and improved readability
- Implement proper message grouping and timestamps
- Add visual affordances similar to popular chat apps (typing indicators, online status)
- Enhance chat input with modern features (emoji picker, formatting options)
- Ensure responsive design for mobile devices
- Maintain accessibility standards
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Message bubbles have modern styling with proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- Timestamps are displayed appropriately (smart grouping by time)
- Chat input supports emoji selection and basic formatting
- UI is fully responsive across mobile and desktop
- Visual design takes inspiration from WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack without copying

### 2. Share Feature & Multi-User Collaboration
**Objective**: Ensure share links work properly and enable multiple users to join chat rooms
**Description**:
- Fix and enhance the existing share link functionality
- Implement real-time multi-user chat capabilities
- Add user presence indicators (online/offline status)
- Create smooth onboarding flow for invited users
- Handle permissions and access control for shared conversations
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Share links generate correctly and remain valid
- Invited users can successfully join conversations through share links
- Multiple users can chat in real-time with proper message sync
- Online status and typing indicators work across all participants
- Conversation ownership and permissions are properly managed

### 3. Multiple AI Model Support
**Objective**: Add support for different AI models with user selection capability
**Description**:
- Create UI for model selection (dropdown or settings panel)
- Extend backend to support multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- Add cost tracking and usage metrics per model
- Allow users to switch models for different use cases (testing vs production)
- Store user preferences for model selection
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Users can select from available AI models via intuitive UI
- Backend supports multiple AI providers with unified interface
- Cost tracking works accurately across different models
- User model preferences persist across sessions
- Model switching is seamless without conversation interruption

### 4. Conversational AI Responses
**Objective**: Replace structured analysis output with natural conversational responses
**Description**:
- Modify AI prompts to generate conversational responses instead of structured data
- Keep responses concise but natural and engaging
- Add follow-up questions to encourage continued conversation
- Maintain context awareness while being conversational
- Format responses for better readability in chat interface
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AI responses are conversational and natural, not bullet points or structured data
- Responses are concise (2-3 sentences typical) but engaging
- Each AI response ends with a relevant follow-up question
- Response formatting is optimized for chat bubble display
- Conversation flow feels natural and encouraging

### 5. Conversation History Context
**Objective**: Include conversation history in AI prompts for better context awareness
**Description**:
- Implement context building from conversation history
- Optimize message history for token efficiency
- Ensure AI responses consider previous messages
- Handle long conversations with proper context truncation
- Maintain conversation coherence across message exchanges
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AI responses demonstrate awareness of previous conversation context
- Context building is token-efficient and doesn't exceed model limits
- Long conversations maintain coherence through intelligent history truncation
- Response quality improves noticeably with conversation context
- Performance remains acceptable even with context inclusion

### 6. Role-Based Access Control
**Objective**: Hide admin features (experiments, teams, analytics) from regular users
**Description**:
- Implement proper role checking middleware
- Hide experiments page from non-admin users
- Hide teams page from non-admin users
- Hide analytics/cost dashboard from non-admin users
- Update navigation and routing to respect user roles
- Ensure admin features are completely inaccessible to regular users
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Regular users cannot access experiments, teams, or analytics pages
- Navigation menus hide admin-only items for regular users
- Direct URL access to admin pages is blocked for non-admin users
- Role checking is consistent across all admin features
- Admin users retain full access to all features

### 7. Real Analytics Data Integration
**Objective**: Replace hardcoded values in analytics page with actual data
**Description**:
- Connect cost dashboard to real usage data from Convex
- Replace mock team data with actual team queries
- Implement real-time cost calculations based on actual usage
- Add proper alert indicators using real threshold data
- Create historical usage analytics with actual data points
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All analytics displays show real data from the application
- Cost calculations reflect actual model usage and pricing
- Team data comes from actual team management system
- Alert indicators trigger based on real usage thresholds
- Historical charts display accurate usage trends over time

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with React
- Backend: Convex (realtime database and functions)
- Authentication: Clerk
- AI Integration: OpenAI (expanding to multiple providers)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

### Performance Requirements
- Real-time messaging with <100ms latency
- AI responses within 3-5 seconds
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Efficient token usage for AI model costs

### Security & Privacy
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Secure API key management
- User data privacy compliance
- Rate limiting for AI model usage

## Success Metrics
- User engagement with improved chat UI
- Successful share link usage rate
- AI model usage distribution across different models
- Reduction in support requests due to better UX
- Admin efficiency improvements with proper role-based access

## Implementation Approach
- Tasks can be developed in parallel using git worktrees
- Each major requirement can be assigned to different development agents
- Regular integration testing to ensure cohesive user experience
- Incremental rollout with feature flags where appropriate
