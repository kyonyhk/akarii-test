			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Redesign Core Chat UI Layout and Message Bubbles",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Redesign Core Chat UI Layout and Message Bubbles' into subtasks. Start with creating an isolated `MessageBubble` component in Storybook with variants for 'sent' and 'received' messages, including user avatars. Then, create a subtask to implement the main chat view layout that will contain the messages. Follow this with a subtask to implement the client-side logic for grouping consecutive messages from the same sender. Another subtask should focus on the logic for displaying timestamps smartly, such as once per message group. Finally, create a subtask dedicated to ensuring the entire chat view is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.",
			"reasoning": "The task is moderately complex, involving both component-level UI work (message bubble) and page-level rendering logic (grouping, timestamps). The complexity comes from managing the state and logic for grouping messages and ensuring a polished, responsive layout, which is more involved than static UI. Breaking it down allows for focused development, starting with the isolated component in Storybook and layering on functionality."

			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Admin Features",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Admin Features' into subtasks. The first subtask is to configure user roles (e.g., 'admin', 'user') within Clerk's user metadata. The second is to create a reusable middleware or helper function in the Convex backend to protect specific queries and mutations by checking the authenticated user's role. The third is to build a `useRole` custom hook in the Next.js frontend to fetch and provide the user's role. The fourth is to use this hook to conditionally render UI elements like admin navigation links. The final subtask is to implement page-level security in Next.js middleware to redirect non-admin users from admin-only pages.",
			"reasoning": "This is a high-complexity, security-critical task that spans the entire stack: auth provider (Clerk), backend (Convex), and frontend (Next.js). Each layer of protection is crucial. Breaking it down by architectural layer (Clerk config, Convex backend, Next.js frontend UI, Next.js routing) ensures each part is implemented correctly and can be tested independently before full integration testing."

			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Real-time Collaboration and Sharing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Enhance Real-time Collaboration and Sharing' into subtasks. First, create the Convex backend logic for generating and validating secure, unique share link tokens for chat rooms, and the associated frontend UI to use them. Second, integrate Convex's presence system to display the online/offline status of participants in the chat. Third, implement the typing indicator feature, including the Convex mutation to update typing status and the frontend logic to display it. Finally, create a subtask for end-to-end testing of all real-time features working in concert across multiple browser sessions.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines three distinct real-time features: sharing, presence, and typing indicators. While Convex simplifies real-time updates, coordinating these features requires careful state management on both the client and server. The complexity lies in ensuring these features are robust and work together seamlessly. Separating them into subtasks allows for focused development and testing of each real-time aspect."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Multi-Model AI Provider Backend and UI",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Multi-Model AI Provider Backend and UI' into subtasks. First, refactor the core AI logic in the Convex backend into a generic `action` and define a common interface for all AI providers using an adapter pattern. Second, implement the first adapter for the OpenAI provider. Third, implement a second adapter for another provider like Anthropic or a mock provider for testing. Fourth, update the database schema to log the specific model used and its associated cost for each message. Fifth, build the frontend UI component using a `shadcn/ui` `Select` to allow users to choose an AI model. Finally, connect this UI to persist the user's selection in their profile.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to significant backend architectural changes (adapter pattern), database schema modifications, and secure configuration for multiple providers. It's a foundational change for future AI work. Breaking it down allows for tackling the backend refactoring first, then implementing individual providers, modifying the database, and finally building the user-facing controls."

			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor AI for Conversational, Context-Aware Responses",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Refactor AI for Conversational, Context-Aware Responses' into subtasks. The first subtask is to modify the Convex AI `action` to fetch the recent message history for the current conversation. The second is to implement a token counting and context truncation mechanism, using a library like `tiktoken`, to ensure the prompt fits within the AI model's context limit. The third is to update the system prompt and message formatting to instruct the AI to be conversational and context-aware. The final subtask should be dedicated to iteratively testing and refining the prompt against various conversation scenarios to ensure high-quality, natural responses.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is high, not just from the technical implementation (fetching history, counting tokens) but from the 'soft' skill of prompt engineering required to achieve the desired conversational tone. This often requires significant iteration. Separating the mechanical parts (fetching history, truncation) from the creative part (prompt design and testing) is a logical approach."

			"taskTitle": "Integrate Real Data into Analytics Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Integrate Real Data into Analytics Dashboard' into subtasks. First, create a new Convex query to aggregate AI usage costs from message logs, with options to group by day, week, or model. Second, create another Convex query to fetch team member data for the dashboard. Third, refactor the Next.js analytics page to remove all mock data and use the `useQuery` hook to fetch data from the new Convex queries. Finally, connect the fetched data to the existing `recharts` components to render the live visualizations.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard data integration task of moderate complexity. The main challenge lies in writing efficient and correct aggregation queries on the backend. The frontend work of replacing mock data with live data from hooks is straightforward. Breaking the task down by query and then a final frontend integration task creates a clear and manageable workflow."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Interactive Chat Input Features",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Interactive Chat Input Features' into subtasks. The first subtask is to integrate an emoji picker library into the chat input component, including a button to toggle its visibility and logic to insert emojis. The second is to use a library like `react-markdown` within the message bubble component to render basic markdown formatting (like `*bold*` and `_italic_`). The final subtask is to ensure both the emoji picker and the input field are styled correctly and are fully responsive on mobile devices.",
			"reasoning": "This task has low complexity as it primarily involves integrating well-established third-party libraries for common, solved problems (emoji pickers, markdown rendering). The main effort is in the UI integration and styling, not in developing complex logic from scratch. The subtasks logically separate the input feature (emoji picker) from the output rendering (markdown)."
