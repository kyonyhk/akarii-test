# Task 14.3 - Secure API Key Management Setup

## Completion Status: ✅ DONE

### Implementation Summary

Task 14.3 has been successfully completed with the following implementations:

1. **Convex Environment Variables Setup**
   - Configured secure storage for AI provider API keys in Convex dashboard
   - Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in Convex settings
   - Added `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable in Convex settings
   - Environment variables are securely stored and accessible via `process.env`

2. **Local Development Configuration**
   - Created `.env.local` template file with placeholder API keys
   - Added `.env.local` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of sensitive data
   - Provided clear documentation for required API key formats

3. **Security Best Practices**
   - API keys are stored securely in Convex environment (not in code)
   - Local development uses `.env.local` which is git-ignored
   - Clear separation between development and production configurations

### Files Modified/Created

- `.env.local` - Template file for local development (git-ignored)
- Convex dashboard environment variables configured

### Next Steps

- Developers should copy `.env.local` and add their actual API keys for local development
- Production API keys are already configured in Convex environment
- AI provider adapters can now securely access API keys via `process.env`

### Testing

- ✅ Verified `.env.local` is properly git-ignored
- ✅ Confirmed Convex environment variables are accessible
- ✅ API key template format documented for all supported providers
