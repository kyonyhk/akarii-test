## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Question Analysis Accuracy (Priority: Critical)

**Current Status**: 43.7% approval rate
**Impact**: Affects 298 analyses (23.9% of total volume)

**Root Causes**:

- Misclassification of rhetorical vs. genuine questions
- Inadequate context understanding for complex queries
- Over-confidence in uncertain interpretations

**Recommended Actions**:

- Implement enhanced question type classification (genuine, rhetorical, clarifying)
- Add context window expansion for question analysis
- Reduce confidence thresholds for question-type statements by 15%
- Create specialized prompt templates for different question categories

**Expected Impact**: 65%+ approval rate within 2 weeks

### 2. Confidence Calibration Issues (Priority: High)

**Current Status**: High-confidence analyses (90-100%) showing 71% approval vs. expected 85%+
**Impact**: 357 analyses with overconfident predictions

**Root Causes**:

- Model overconfidence in edge cases
- Insufficient uncertainty quantification
- Lack of calibration against historical performance

**Recommended Actions**:

- Implement confidence score recalibration based on historical accuracy
- Add uncertainty penalties for complex or ambiguous statements
- Create confidence validation pipeline with human feedback loop
- Establish confidence threshold adjustments per statement type

**Expected Impact**: Improved reliability and user trust

### 3. Statement Classification Ambiguity (Priority: High)

**Current Status**: "Other" category has 43% approval rate
**Impact**: 68 analyses with unclear categorization

**Root Causes**:

- Insufficient training on edge case classifications
- Overlapping category definitions
- Missing context for nuanced statements

**Recommended Actions**:

- Refine classification taxonomy with clearer boundaries
- Implement multi-label classification for hybrid statements
- Add human validation for "Other" category assignments
- Create escalation path for ambiguous classifications

**Expected Impact**: Reduce "Other" category usage by 60%

## Systematic Improvement Areas

### A. Content Quality Issues

#### Missing Belief Extraction (18 instances)

**Problem**: Analyses failing to identify underlying beliefs in statements
**Solution**:

- Enhanced belief detection algorithms
- Contextual semantic analysis improvement
- Training data augmentation with belief-rich examples

#### Missing Trade-off Analysis (15 instances)

**Problem**: Failure to identify decision trade-offs and considerations
**Solution**:

- Implement structured trade-off analysis framework
- Add economic and social impact consideration prompts
- Create trade-off validation checklist

#### Missing Context Integration (9 instances)

**Problem**: Analyses not incorporating sufficient conversational context
**Solution**:

- Expand context window from 3 to 7 previous messages
- Implement conversation state tracking
- Add participant relationship mapping

### B. Technical Improvements

#### Real-time Quality Monitoring

- Implement live approval rate tracking per analyst
- Create automated quality alerts for dropping performance
- Establish feedback loop for immediate corrections

#### A/B Testing Framework

- Test different prompt variations for low-performing categories
- Measure impact of confidence threshold adjustments
- Validate improvement strategies with controlled experiments

#### Enhanced Analytics Pipeline

- Daily performance dashboards for all stakeholders
- Predictive modeling for quality trends
- Automated improvement recommendation system
