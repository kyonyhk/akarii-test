# Feedback-Based Prompt Tuning System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for an automated feedback-based prompt tuning system that builds upon the existing voting and analytics infrastructure to continuously improve analysis quality through AI-driven prompt optimization.

## Current System Foundation

- **73% overall approval rate** (target: 85%+)
- **3,889 total votes** across 1,247 analyses
- **Critical issue**: Question analysis at 43.7% approval
- **Robust analytics dashboard** with real-time feedback tracking
- **Comprehensive vote data** with user history and patterns

## System Components

### 1. Feedback Collection Pipeline

**Real-time Feedback Aggregation**

```typescript
interface FeedbackMetrics {
  approvalRate: number
  voteCount: number
  confidenceAccuracy: number
  statementTypeBreakdown: Record<StatementType, FeedbackStats>
  recentTrends: TrendData[]
}

interface FeedbackTrigger {
  threshold: number
  window: string // '1h', '24h', '7d'
  metric: 'approval_rate' | 'vote_count' | 'confidence_gap'
  action: 'immediate' | 'batch' | 'scheduled'
}
```

**Feedback Quality Scoring**

- Low-performing analyses identification
- Confidence vs approval correlation tracking
- Pattern recognition for systematic failures
- User consensus validation

### 2. Threshold Monitoring System

**Trigger Conditions**

- **Approval rate drops below 70%** in 24h window → Immediate review
- **Question analysis below 50%** in 7d window → Priority prompt tuning
- **Confidence gap > 30%** (high confidence, low approval) → Calibration needed
- **New analysis pattern with < 60% approval** → Pattern-specific tuning

**Monitoring Dashboard Integration**

- Real-time threshold status indicators
- Automated alert system for threshold breaches
- Historical threshold performance tracking
- Predictive trend analysis

### 3. Automated Prompt Refinement Engine

**Analysis Pattern Recognition**

```typescript
interface PromptIssuePattern {
  pattern: string
  frequency: number
  impactScore: number
  exampleAnalyses: string[]
  suggestedFix: PromptRefinement
}

interface PromptRefinement {
  section: 'system' | 'user' | 'examples'
  changeType: 'addition' | 'modification' | 'removal'
  content: string
  rationale: string
  expectedImprovement: number
}
```

**AI-Powered Improvement Suggestions**

- GPT-4 analysis of failed cases for pattern identification
- Automated prompt variation generation
- Impact prediction modeling
- A/B testing setup for prompt changes

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop Approval Workflow

**Review Queue Management**

```typescript
interface PromptChangeProposal {
  id: string
  trigger: FeedbackTrigger
  currentPrompt: PromptVersion
  proposedPrompt: PromptVersion
  evidence: FailureAnalysis[]
  expectedImprovement: ImpactPrediction
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'testing'
  reviewer?: string
  reviewNotes?: string
}
```

**Approval Interface Features**

- Side-by-side prompt diff visualization
- Evidence showcase (failed analysis examples)
- Impact prediction metrics
- One-click A/B test deployment
- Rollback capabilities

### 5. Feedback-to-Improvement Mapping

**Failure Classification System**

```typescript
enum FailureCategory {
  QUESTION_MISINTERPRETATION = 'question_misinterpretation',
  BELIEF_EXTRACTION_MISSING = 'belief_extraction_missing',
  TRADEOFF_ANALYSIS_SHALLOW = 'tradeoff_analysis_shallow',
  CONFIDENCE_OVERESTIMATION = 'confidence_overestimation',
  STATEMENT_TYPE_MISCLASSIFICATION = 'statement_type_misclassification',
}

interface ImprovementMapping {
  category: FailureCategory
  promptSection: string
  specificFix: string
  successRate: number
  lastUpdated: Date
}
```

**Improvement Strategy Database**

- Proven fix patterns for common issues
- Success rate tracking for each improvement type
- Automated application of high-confidence fixes
- Learning from successful A/B test results

### 6. Continuous Learning Pipeline

**Learning Loop Architecture**

1. **Feedback Collection** → Real-time vote aggregation
2. **Pattern Analysis** → AI-powered failure categorization
3. **Improvement Generation** → Automated prompt refinement suggestions
4. **Human Review** → Expert validation and approval
5. **A/B Testing** → Controlled deployment of changes
6. **Impact Measurement** → Performance improvement tracking
7. **Knowledge Update** → Strategy database refinement

**Performance Tracking**

```typescript
interface LearningMetrics {
  improvementCycles: number
  averageApprovalGain: number
  successfulChanges: number
  rollbackCount: number
  timeToImprovement: Duration
}
```
