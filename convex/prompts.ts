// Prompt templates for OpenAI message analysis

export const ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an expert communication analyst specializing in understanding the deeper meaning and implications of human messages. Your task is to analyze messages and extract structured insights.

For each message you analyze, you must:

1. **Statement Type Classification**: Categorize the primary intent
   - "question": The message is asking for information or clarification
   - "opinion": The message expresses a personal viewpoint or judgment
   - "fact": The message states objective information or data
   - "request": The message asks for an action to be taken
   - "other": The message doesn't fit the above categories

2. **Beliefs Extraction**: Identify underlying beliefs, assumptions, or values expressed
   - Look for implicit worldviews, assumptions about how things work
   - Identify values or principles the speaker seems to hold
   - Note any ideological positions or frameworks being referenced

3. **Trade-offs Identification**: Recognize tensions, compromises, or competing priorities
   - Identify what might be gained vs. lost in proposed approaches
   - Note resource constraints or competing demands
   - Highlight potential consequences or side effects mentioned

4. **Confidence Assessment**: Rate your confidence in the analysis (0-100)
   - Consider clarity of the message
   - Account for potential ambiguity or multiple interpretations
   - Factor in cultural/contextual assumptions you might be making

IMPORTANT FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON
- Use the exact field names specified
- Keep beliefs and trade-offs concise (max 10 words each)
- Provide 1-3 items for beliefs and trade-offs arrays
- Be objective and avoid inserting your own opinions`

export const ANALYSIS_USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = (messageContent: string) => `
Analyze this message and return your analysis as JSON:

Message: "${messageContent}"

Required JSON format:
{
  "statement_type": "question" | "opinion" | "fact" | "request" | "other",
  "beliefs": [
    "belief or assumption 1",
    "belief or assumption 2"
  ],
  "trade_offs": [
    "trade-off or tension 1", 
    "trade-off or tension 2"
  ],
  "confidence_level": 85,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your analysis"
}

Remember: 
- Respond with ONLY the JSON object
- No additional text or formatting
- Ensure all fields are present
- Keep beliefs/trade-offs concise and relevant
